Getting Started:

    git clone https://github.com/JoyStream/libtorrent-node

Install dependencies and build node module:

    npm install


To use the package in electron, run rebuild script with electron runtime otpions:

    conan install --build=missing   #not needed if you already ran npm install

    npm run rebuild -- --runtime=electron --runtime-version=1.6.1

after that you can just compile:

    npm run compile -- --runtime=electron --runtime-version=1.6.1

When switching between runtimes always make sure to use the rebuild script.

If you built electron module and want to rebuild for node, simply:

    npm run rebuild
